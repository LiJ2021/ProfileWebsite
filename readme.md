My Strategy

 Browns and tans exude warmth and calm, and remind me of nature, and I chose a fixed background that reflects nature and complements the colors. I found a picture on unsplash by Vincent Burkhead that reminds me of the sailing stones of Death Valley. Hero images were something that I learned with Code Louisville, so I understand how to implement them. All of the images that were used were found on unsplash, and I left the original names on the images so that people could search for them if they wanted to.

I incorporated anchor tags in my navigation bar to give users an additional option to jump directly to a section on the page. I made it fixed so that where ever they are on the page they have the nav bar as a point of reference. It was fun and adds to the functionality of the page, especially as it starts to get longer. I added a shadow on the nav bar for a little razzle-dazzle.

I like to use percentages, pixels, or rems when dealing with some aspects of website building because it more easily expands or compresses to fit the width of the viewing page and keep its original dimensions, which can aide in the comfort of the users experience and engaging with the website. But, like flexgrid and flexboxes, it takes time to figure out which ones are most beneficial in which section, and my website reflects that.

I am still exploring and discovering personal style through my profile page.  Once I am comfortable incorporating JS and become familiar with canvas I will have more of an idea of what I want my website to convey.
