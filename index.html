                        <p>I have always been curious about how things work. At a young age I was often found taking things apart - radios, telephones,  and old televisions, trying to discover what made them work.  Along the way I started tinkering with computer hardware - trying to figure out how they stored and displayed information locally, and what components could be integrated to make them function differently.  Exploring computer hardware seemed to naturally lead to computer software, and I have been exploring technology ever since. </p>
                
                        <p> These interests led me to pre-engineering programs in high school, and then to engineering in college. All learning did not take place on college campuses though - I have been able to complete different certification programs and bootcamps that led to obtaining my CompTIA A+, Microsoft Certified Professional, and Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator, as well as certifications in Web Development - utlizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. </p>

                            <p>Click the image above to be taken to the github repository. This project will tell you the current weather conditions in different cities around the world.  If you enter a city in the text field, it will return the city name, state or country, current weather in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, and an image representing the weather conditions of that location.  This was achieved by creating a server that returns the data retrieved from the API to the user via the results page.  I used the free weather API at weatherapi.com.  The background used is from unsplash - an artist by the name of Levan Badzgaradze.</p>

I took inspiration from social media sites like Reddit, focusing on naturally occurring wonders observed around the globe. It allows a user to upload image links, enter a description of the image and its location, vote for an entry, and load additional images to vote on at the click of a button.  This is a work in progress, with the goal of eventually allowing a user to view a series of images, upvote or downvote an image, see the top images and view the net score that each image has accumulated.
